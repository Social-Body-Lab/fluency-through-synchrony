# Study 3 Experiment
To run, download all files in this folder. You will also need all the video files available in the Study 3 folder on the OSF here: https://osf.io/vg8ky/. 
Place them in a folder called videoStim, in the same directory as Study3.psyexp.
Make sure you have PsychoPy installed (version 3.1.5 or later) and run Study3.psyexp. 
When prompted, ensure 'Track Eyes' is set to 0, unless you have a Pupil Core eye tracker connected.
